## 🌺 About Me

My name is Laura. I hold a degree in Mathematical Sciences from Complutense University of Madrid and am passionate about quantum computing research. I entered this field in January 2023 as a Quantum Algorithm Researcher at aQuantum (Madrid), specializing in quantum annealing and optimizing implementations for real-world applications. Since September 2024, I've been working as an Associate Researcher in the Quantum Hardware group at TII's Quantum Research Center (Abu Dhabi), focusing on quantum processor characterization and calibration, while simultaneously pursuing my Master's in Quantum Computing Technology at Polytechnic University of Madrid.


## 📚 Education and Experience

- **Master’s in Quantum Technology** - Polytechnic University of Madrid (currently enrolled in)
- **Bachelor's Degree in Mathematical Sciences** - Complutense University of Madrid 
  - Dissertation: "Diffusive Logistic Equation and Its Applications to Ecology"
    
I am also continuously pursuing parallel training, obtaining numerous certificates such as Quantum Device Workshop UCLAxUSC 2025, Womanium Quantum Computing + AI, Qiskit Fall Fest 2023, and QWorld's QBronce and QNickel certificates.

## 📝Research 

### Characterization and calibration of quantum devices

### Performance of binary-integer encodings in an Ising machine
Analysis of the state of the art of key concepts in annealing algorithmics with a special impact on solution quality.

### Estimation of hyperparameters in an Ising-type Hamiltonian
Identifying the optimal range for hyperparameters in Ising-type Hamiltonians, crucial for tuning constraint intensities and improving solution quality. It involved analyzing how varying these parameters impacts solution performance and exploring practices used by quantum annealing companies to manage them effectively.
