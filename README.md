## 🌺 About Me

My name is Laura, I graduated in Mathematical Sciences from Complutense University of Madrid and I have a deep passion for research in Quantum Computer Science. I embarked on this innovative field in January 2023, focusing on the paradigm of quantum annealing. My work has involved developing quantum algorithms and continuously improving their implementation, contributing to the advancement and practical application of these emerging technologies. In October 2024, I will begin a Master's in Quantum Computing Technology at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.
